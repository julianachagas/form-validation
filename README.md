## Form validation

Form validation in JavaScript using Regular Expressions. 

The project contains a registration form the user can fill out to create an account, entering a username, email, and password. Each input is validated with regular expressions following a set of rules:

- username: it must be between 5 - 15 characters long and contain only letters and numbers
- email: it must be a valid address, e.g. me@mydomain.com or me@domain.co.uk
- password: it must contain letters, numbers, @, _ or -, and be between 8 - 20 characters long

Regular Expressions:

```javascript
const patterns = {
  username: /^[a-z\d]{5,15}$/i,
  email: /^[a-z\d\.-]+@[a-z\d-]+\.[a-z]+(\.[a-z]+)?$/i,
  password: /^[\w@\-]{8,20}$/
};
```
